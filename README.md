#FeedReader

This is an RSS feed reader created using [Vinoth's tutorial on Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/building-an-rss-reader-in-rails-is-easy/). It uses Feedjira and the Whenever gem to load and update RSS feeds. I didn't like the routes used in the original tutorial so I've changed them slightly.
